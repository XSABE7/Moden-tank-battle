Hello everyone! Now I am trying to develop the game myself (maybe) because I haven't learned anything about java and I still don't know... But since this project is open source, anyone can help develop the gameSo this project will have nothing but the game concept and idea

Thanks to all the developers who came to help. Note: I need help right now, including someone to teach me how to write Java.
